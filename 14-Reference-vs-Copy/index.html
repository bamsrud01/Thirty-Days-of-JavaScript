    console.log('Arrays reference the original.  team is a reference to players, so when team is changed, players is also changed.');

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    console.log('We can make a copy rather than a reference, using slice with no arguments');

    team2[3] = 'Poppy';

    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players];

    let team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Barrett Amsrud',
      age: 25
    };
    // with Objects
    // and think we make a copy:
    const me = person;
    console.log(person, me);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const me2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person, me2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      //  Not yet working, but hopefully an upcoming feature
      // const me3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
