# CSS Variables

This project uses CSS variables to dynamically update the text/padding color, padding size, and blur level of the page.

## Features

- The UI includes range and color inputs to allow the user to change these attributes as desired.
- The range and color sliders allow the user to see changes as the slider is moved, not only as the mouse is released.
