# 26 - Stripe Follow Along Nav

This application creates a white background around items in a navbar that appears to follow from item to item

## Features

- The items in the navbar fade in and out when a mouse enters or leaves
- The background size and location is set based on the size and location of the items in the navbar element
- When changing from nav item to item, the size transforms rather than instantly changing size and location
