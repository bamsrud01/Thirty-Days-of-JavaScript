# 06 - Type Ahead

This project fetches information from 1000 US cities, and will automatically show matches by city or state name when the user enters or changes a search term

## Features

- All data is fetched using an AJAX request, and stored in a variable
- The match function is run every time the user changes the data in the search box
- All matching items are added to the DOM as the user changes the input
- Matching text is highlighted, and large numbers are displayed with commas
