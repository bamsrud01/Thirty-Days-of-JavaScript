# Flex Gallery

This application is an example of a gallery using flexbox and transitions to dynamically open and close gallery items.

## Features

- Clicking on an item will make it grow, and reveal hidden text content hidden above and below the view.
- Each gallery item will dynamically grow and shrink due to space allocated using the flex property.
