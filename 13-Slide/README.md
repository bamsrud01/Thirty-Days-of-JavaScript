# 13 - Slide In on Scroll

This application includes images that slide into focus as the user scrolls down the page

## Features

- The application hides all images by default
- As the user scrolls down, images are revealed, animated to slide into position
- As revealed images go out of view, they are again hidden by the application
- The application includes a debounce function, ensuring that the application runs once every 20 milliseconds, rather than every millisecond, improving performance
