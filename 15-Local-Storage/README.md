# 15 - Local Storage and Event Delegation

This application allows users to create a checklist of tapas.  It will save the list to local memory so the user does not need to re-enter data every time.

## Features

- All created items will be saved to local storage
- Checking a checkbox orders a parent to save the new checkbox status
