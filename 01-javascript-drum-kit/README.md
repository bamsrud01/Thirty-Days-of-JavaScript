# 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

The JavaScript Drum Kit allows users to use their keyboard to play a virtual drum.

## Features

- Uses Vanilla JavaScript to detect keydown events, find associated sound elements, and play the audio files.
- Audio files will start from the beginning if the associated key is pressed before the audio finishes running.
- DOM elements are animated to show the user which key is pressed.
- Audio files downloaded from the challenge GitHub page [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit).
