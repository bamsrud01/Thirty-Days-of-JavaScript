# 22 - Follow Along Link Highlighter

This application creates a visual highlight that follows the mouse whenever the user hovers over a link element.

## Features

- A highlight span is created and moves based on triggers, which are all link elements in this case
- The highlight coordinates take into account whether the user has scrolled horizontally or vertically, ensuring that it is applied to the correct location
